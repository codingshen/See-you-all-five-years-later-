# See you five years later

## Hello, All friends

I am the maintainer of the Geek Studio and this github account.

Our studio members, including me,  are a branch of Chinese students who loves programing together,making games, applications,frameworks, but we have to pass the most important two exams in our life which is the High school entrance examination and college entrance examination.These two exams determine which high school and college we will go to. This is very helpless for Chinese students. So start today, our studio will stop programing, stop updating code on github, and all repositories includes the Graphics Game Engine and all kinds of library we made, will set to PRIVATE until we finish the exams five years later.

We are very sad about that. Huge thanks for everyone.

Thanks! Bye!
